# Exam class for the TUC Operating System Group
This is the template for our exams, which relies on the [LaTeX exam class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/exam). It supports:
  - Useful defaults for layout and titlepage
  - Automated generation of personalized exams from a list of students.
  - Automated handling of multilangual exams
  - Flexible directory layout for source and output documents
  
  In addition, there are Python scripts for:
  - Generation of a seating plan, based on predefined room capacities.
  - Generation of a checklist for students showing up.
  - Generation of grading proposals based on ECTS.

This is still work in progress.

## Dockerized installation
### Prerequisites
- docker: `brew install --cask docker`

### Procedure
- build a docker image based on the provided Dockerfile: `docker build -t osg-exam .`
  - `osg-exam` is the name of the image, that's your choice.
- test with provided example exam:
```bash
cd doc
docker run --rm -it -v .:/workdir osg-exam sh -c "latexmk osgexam-example.tex"
```
- from this point on, exams in any folder can be build via this command, just adapt `osgexam-example.tex` to the corresponding source file

### TODOs
- provide an easier way to invoke compliation
- make use of `inotify-tools` to provide a `latexmk -pvc`-like experience

## Local installation
### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.6
- latexmk >= 4.61
- LuaLaTeX >= 1.04

### Procedure
- if necessary, install openpyxl: `pip3 install openpyxl`
- clone this repo to a folder, e.g. `git clone git@github.com:tuc-osg/osg-exam.git ~/Documents`
- prepare a folder for the local tex tree: `mkdir -p $(kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME)/tex`
- link the class subfolder to that directory: `ln -s ~/Documents/osg-exam/osgexam $(kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME)/tex/osgexam`
- if necessary, run `sudo texhash` if the class isn't found.
- You can get an update with `git pull` inside your local repository (`~/Documents/osg-exam`)

## Usage
- Create a new latex document with the osgexam class and set the option "development"
- Run `lualatex -shell-escape <source.tex>`
   - Alternatively: copy `latexmkrc` to your directory and run `latexmk <source.tex>`
- For interactive mode, comment out *development* option

## Rules
- In `<exam>.xlsx`, the following format must be kept:
  - All data is on the first sheet.
  - There are columns with the name {Matrikelnummer|Matr-Nr|ID|student
    Id}, {Vorname|first name|surname|given name}, and
    {Name|surname|family name}, and possibly {Platz|seat|place}, respectively (not case sensitive)
  - There are no empty rows.
